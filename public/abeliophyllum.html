      <p><strong>Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf)</strong>
        is a monotypic
        genus of flowering plants in the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of
        one species, <strong>Abeliophyllum distichum</strong> Nakai, endemic to
        Korea, where it
        is endangered in the wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related
        to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow, flowers.</p>
      <p>It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1 to 2 m tall. The leaves are
        opposite, simple, 6 to 10 cm long and 3 to 4.5 cm wide, pubescent both
        above and below. The flowers are produced in early spring before the new
        leaves appear; they are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a
        four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2 to 3 cm
        diameter.</p>
      <p>It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America.
