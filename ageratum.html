      <p>Ageratum, (whiteweed in the USA), is a genus of 40[3] to 60 tropical
        and warm temperate flowering annuals and perennials from the family
        Asteraceae, tribe Eupatorieae. Most species are native to Central
        America and Mexico but four are native to the United States.</p>
      <p>They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The
        opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins are
        slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters.</p>
      <p>The fluffy flowers are lavender-blue, pink, lilac, or white; and spread
        in small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.</p>
